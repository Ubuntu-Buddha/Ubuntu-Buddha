### What I Build

**Solana Infrastructure** — Transaction pipelines, real-time data feeds, PDA utilities (Rust, TypeScript)

**Financial Systems** — Loan origination, underwriting workflows, payment processing (PHP, Python)

**Trading & Data** — ML-powered market analysis, risk management, async data pipelines (Python)

**AI Integration** — LLM-assisted tooling embedded in production workflows

### How I Work

Ship end-to-end. Design before building. Optimize where it matters.
